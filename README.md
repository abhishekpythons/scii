# scii
scii (pronounced sky) stands for "Students Community of Indian Institutes"

Need for a new platform
 - Being a student of the Indian Institute of space science and technology I tried to find a platform where I could interact with students from IITs, IISc, IIST, IISER, IIIT, and other top-tier institutions.
 - However, I have not been able to locate any such platform where we can share ideas and events, organise official club clashes, and collaborate on projects online.
 - So I envision a platform where students from prestigious institutes may come and broadcast forthcoming activities for everybody on the internet to observe and participate in.
 - We can also find people who share our interests and form inter-college teams to work on projects, compete in games or other competitions, or simply challenge other students.

Future vision
 - This community of wise students has enormous potential and may one day become an amazing virtual world of the country or even the planet.
 - opening up new avenues for project collaboration, Every project will be assigned an appropriate collaborator, and teams will not be limited to a single institution.
 - Students in secondary and higher secondary schools will receive accurate information from the website's publicly accessible section and the community's official virtual noticeboard
 - Students can interact without fear of spam or fake ids because only people with official email addresses can register.

Maybe I can't make this website alone, but I know that with everyone's help, we can create this platform and get people to join it. Let us make this platform the scii foundation's first project collaboration.
I hereby welcome all students who wish to collaborate and express my gratitude for your time and effort.
